netresearch-coding-contest-2012
===============================

This is my implementation of a book database (in colloquial speech "library"). 

It was done for the netresearch-coding-contest-2012.

How to install:


1. Extract the yii framework into your webroot (yii-1.1.10) 
2. Extract the coding contest files into a directory (for example library/)
3. Load the .sql file in protected/docs/library.sql into your mysql database
4. Set the DB Connection in protected/config/main.php
5. Run http://localhost/library
